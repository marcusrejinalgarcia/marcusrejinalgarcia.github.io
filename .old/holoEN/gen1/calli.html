                <h4>Official Bio</h4>
                <p>The Grim Reaper's first apprentice. Due to modern medical care causing a decline in the reaping
                    business, Calliope decided to become a VTuber to harvest souls instead. It seems that the ascended
                    souls of the people who are vaporized by the wholesome interactions between VTubers go to her as
                    well.</p>
                <p>That being said, despite the image her hardcore vocals and manner of speech gives off, she's actually
                    a gentle-hearted girl who cares greatly for her friends.</p>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p><b>Calliope Mori</b>, officially listed as <b>Mori Calliope</b> (森カリオペ), is a reaper Virtual YouTuber
                    who debuted as a member of the Hololive English -Myth-. Her fans and gen-mates often refer to her as
                    <b>Calli</b> for short. Despite being a sweet-voiced girl with a gentle personality, Calli tends to
                    talk about morbid topics with little hesitation. Her favorite color is red, she enjoys sweets and
                    reaping souls, and she likes watching mafia movies and drinking red wine. Her given name,
                    "Calliope," can be mistakenly read as "cantaloupe," a fruit she vehemently despises. (The correct
                    pronunciation is "kuh-LAHY-uh-pee".)
                </p>

                <h4>Personality</h4>
                <p>The Grim Reaper's apprentice has displayed throughout her streams, guest appearances, and music to a
                    have cool, yet serious personality, with a timid side being seen when interacting with others for
                    the first time, such as her senpais. Calli's cool attitude can be clearly observed in most of her
                    streams, as she tries her best to impress the deadbeats with her musical talent and occasional
                    gaming skills. However, she is not afraid to get serious about topics that may be on her mind, and
                    engages in thoughtful discussions with viewers. This combination of a relaxed yet serious
                    personality has earned her the admiration of not only the Deadbeats, but her fellow Holopro talents
                    as well. However, Calli's playful side comes out more evidently during collaborations with her
                    genmates, displaying a side of Calli which viewers don't regularly experience. Calli still remains
                    above all an avid hard worker who is regularly working on projects behind the scenes, often not
                    sleeping for long periods of time. Despite the challenges that she may face while working on these
                    projects, each one is very much rewarded and appreciated by her Deadbeats each time a new original
                    song or cover is released.</p>
