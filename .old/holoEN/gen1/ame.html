                <h4>Official Bio</h4>
                <p>Amelia heard strange rumors online surrounding hololive: talking foxes, magical squirrels, superhuman
                    dogs, and more. Soon after beginning her investigation on hololive, and just out of interest, she
                    decided to become an idol herself!</p>
                <p>She loves to pass her time training her reflexes with FPS games, and challenging herself with puzzle
                    games.</p>
                <p>"It's elementary, right?"</p>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p><b>Amelia H. Watson</b>, officially listed as <b>Watson Amelia</b> (ワトソン・アメリア), is a detective
                    Virtual YouTuber who debuted as a member of Hololive English -Myth-. Amelia is usually referred to
                    by her fans and gen-mates by the pet-name, <b>Ame</b> (アメ).</p>
                <p>When busy with investigating, Amelia likes drinking iced tea and has an affinity for fensi noodles.
                    In her free time, she loves riding roller coasters and sleeping, although the former is difficult
                    due to her disliking going outside and the latter cannot be done if she is clothed. She also
                    dislikes onions, a fact that caused many viewers to joke that she hates Minato Aqua. She hiccups
                    frequently during streams which leads her viewers to comment "HIC". She hypothesizes that these are
                    up-side-down burps that she's converting into cuter hiccups, perhaps as a result of swallowing air
                    during meals. Amelia enjoys FPS games the most such as Apex Legends and Valorant alongside open
                    world games such as Fallout and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>

                <h4>Personality</h4>
                <p>Amelia is a highly active, expressive and kind individual who's often willing to help others,
                    especially her own gen mates. She was said to have helped troubleshoot some of the technical
                    problems her gen mates were having before and during debut which led to the birth to the meme Amelia
                    Tech Tips which is a parody of the popular YouTube channel Linus Tech Tips. Amelia is also highly
                    supportive towards hololive members and frequently comments in any ongoing streams whenever she gets
                    the time to do so. Despite all of these positive traits, Amelia also has another side to her that
                    comically emerges especially when playing in competitive player-versus-player (PvP) games such as
                    Apex Legends that is often dubbed Gremlin mode by her viewers. She often becomes greedy, highly
                    defensive of her own mistakes whilst being highly critical of her teammates actions, and even
                    "salty". Such kinds of behavior has led fans to also calling her a "True Gamer" in the sense that
                    gamers are often considered to be toxic online. Though it is important to note that this doesn't
                    detract from her positive traits but rather makes her streams quite unpredictable and very
                    interesting to watch.</p>
                <p>Amelia can also be quite mischievous and playfully naughty by pulling pranks on her fellow gen mates
                    or making statements and jokes that have inconspicuously lewd undertones. One such popular joke
                    would be her "Ground Pound" which she first mentioned during a Super Mario Odyssey playthrough with
                    a slightly lower pitched and "gremlin-like" voice. She also named a door in Minecraft "Gura's
                    backdoor" with an added lenny emoticon " ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) " that is often used mischievously online.</p>
